# Code Highlight Themes

This is a collection of code highlight themes to be used with Mdx, prism and react-prism-renderer.

The idea of creating this repository came to me when I wrote the post [Add code highlighting to mdx](https://fabiorosado.dev/blog/add-code-highlighting-to-mdx) and I thought it could be good to have a place to add all the different themes that you can build in one place.

## Contributing üëç

There are a lot of themes out there and it would be great if you could contribute with your theme to this repository.

Otherways that you can contribute:

- Improving existing code
- Add CSS versions to themes that only have SCSS
- Fixing typos or expanding the Readme files.
